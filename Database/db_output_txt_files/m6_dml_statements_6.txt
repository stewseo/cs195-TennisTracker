Write a DELETE statement that deletes the row that you added to the Categories table in exercise 1.
When you execute this statement, it will produce an error since the category has related rows in the Products table.
To fix that, precede the DELETE statement with another DELETE statement that deletes all products in this category.
(Remember that to code two or more statements in a script, you must end each statement with a semicolon.)
